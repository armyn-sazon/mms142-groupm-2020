      <h4> FUTURE</h4>
      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 50px; line-height: 50px"> What Music Will be Like in the Future? </h2>
      <p>Most of us play music to express ourselves and to improve our mood. It indeed aids us in reducing stress, boosting memory, and relieving symptoms of depression. Hence, music streaming can be a lot better than what it is today.</p>
      <p>Smart speakers commonly operate through conversations and sentences. We use our voice to speak what song comes next or any instructions we want to tell. Yet, music streaming's development is perceived as similar to the "Experience Disks" from Black Mirror. Fifteen or twenty years from now, Spotify might be replaced with a first-brain computer interface for music consumption called YouNite beads. It is described as a totally "frictionless," "seamless" media encounter that exceeds the inadequacies of the static device, molding itself directly to our minds and thought processes in real-time.</p>
      <p>It works on the level of individual pulses, breaths, heartbeat rhythm, and even neurons. Consequently, YouNite no longer needs visual screens. Its common use is for self-regulation â€” listening to a soundtrack to develop one's physical and mental well-being and handle an individual's negative feelings.</p>
      <p>YouNite bead is easy to use. The operating system will turn on once plugged in on your ear. It will ask you to choose one from three modes of consumption: Freestyle, Stasis, and Adaptation. Freestyle mode is like the typical streaming in which you can shuffle an album or request a song using a speech command. Meanwhile, Statis mode allows you to utilize music to support a rational or physiological condition of your choice. The song choice will be determined according to your heart rate, body temperature, and breathing rhythm and pattern. YouNite can detect stress signals. Hence, it will send audio advice to verify you are no longer relaxed and, with a single swipe by your ear, the song switches immediately. Lastly, the Adaptation mode is the most interesting and applicable of all. Using Weav-style technology, the song's rhythm, timbre, and energy level will adjust based on your environment. For example, the song will sound smooth when you are driving a car or will go slowly when alone.</p>
      <p>As Spotify can create numerous suggested playlists for each user conforming to the previously played soundtracks, then it is possible for the music streaming to be bizarre and more developed in the best possible way by using our emotions, conditions, and environment as the variables.</p>
