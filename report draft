Since the beginning of the digital era, music streaming services have steadily risen as the go-to means of listening to music in comparison to physical albums and singles, which have seen less and less sales over the years due to these very services.


People nowadays would rather listen to playlists that are specially tailored to a certain mood, genre, activity, or popularity, thus the rise of streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music among many others. This resulted to various record labels from issuing and releasing CDs, which in turn resulted to retail stores deciding to not sell any.


The effect that music streaming services has on physical album and song sales has led the music industry to shift their focus away from that. This is evident from the 2018 year-end report figures from BuzzAngle, a data company that tracks music consumption. The report showed that album and song sales went down to 18.2% and 28.8% respectively, meanwhile total on-demand music streams shot up to 35.4%. From BuzzAngle’s data report as well, 77% of the music that U.S. fans listen to was through music-streaming services while the remaining 17.3% and 5.7% was through album and single sales respectively.


In a 2019 survey conducted by Deezer, a streaming service, 42% of the 2,000 adults that were surveyed in the UK create playlists of their favorite songs. Majority of those under 25 years old were found to be “more likely to arrange their music into playlists than listen to an album” from start to finish. Meanwhile, 15% of the people in that age group have never listened to a full album. Though these results are limited to the U.K. only, there’s no doubt that music streaming services have changed how music is consumed overall.


Due to the rising popularity of streaming services, it has impacted as well how artists and bands release their music. Mark Mulligan, a music industry analyst who believes that the album and its format have been slowly dying off for years, stated


“[The digital transformation and a world of competing media] had created an appetite for “post-album artists” who release their music as a continuous series of singles, a format more suited to the short-attention-span generation”.”


Several musicians like Tinie Tempah and the Cult’s Ian Austbury have acknowledged the album’s apparent decline, the former having stated to be uncertain if another album will come out after the third while the latter declared the format to be dead. Though Fraser T Smith, a Grammy-winning producer, believed that albums “would remain resilient and relevant owing to a select few artists.”


Many may argue if albums are truly dying, replaced by the streaming of singles and playlists, but there’s no denying that music streaming services are dominating in terms of music consumption especially in this digital era. And seeing and experiencing for ourselves its ascent to the top, it is no doubt causing disruption along the way, therefore qualifying it as a disruptive innovation. As said by George Ergatoudis, “the digital revolution is transforming the industry and that is unstoppable, whether we like it is irrelevant.”
