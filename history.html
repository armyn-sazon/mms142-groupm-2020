      <h4> HISTORY </h4>
      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 50px; line-height: 50px"> History of Sound Recording </h2>
      <p>Streaming digital singles, albums, and playlists are what drives the music industry today. But thanks to technological advancements, a lot of changes and shifts occurred over the years before music streaming services dominated the music industry, which has changed how music is recorded, distributed, and consumed today.</p>
      <p>Back in the early 20th century, the music industry was run by sheet music publishers, with house concerts being the means of how their music was “distributed” to and “consumed” by the middle-class. But this was overtaken by phonographs and gramophones (also known as graphopones) becoming widely available by the 1920s; its popularity back then was evident through its high gross sales, with the US market reaching $106 million ($1,5 billion in today’s money) in 1921, and records sold, which saw 140 million sold in that year. This led to major phonograph producers Columbia, Victor, and Edison to being record-makers and the first record labels.</p>
      <p>The music industry was once again changed with the birth of the radio a decade later, which was free and had better sound quality than the phonograms. By the 1930s, radio corporations bought all of the big recording players in the U.S. at the time: The Radio Corporation of America bought Victor in 1929 to create RCA Records, and the Columbia Broadcasting System bought Columbia Records in 1939. In 1931, Victor’s and Columbia’s European affiliates merged to form EMI Records. The radio’s popularity back then could be attributed to record labels producing records to be played on the radio, which not only boosted its sales but also increased the demand for new hits.</p>
      <p>After the radio came the LP, or long play vinyl records, which was produced by Columbia Records in 1948. This new medium made it possible to fit 20 minutes or more of music in each side of the disc, which not only offered a fuller set of music but also opened up the concept of the album. Then came a portable means of playing music, the cassette tapes. Introduced in the 1970s, it allowed listeners to play music by inserting the tapes into their car dashboard, boom box, or cassette tape player. By the 1990s, the cassette tapes were replaced by compact discs, or CDs, which offered a more portable way of playing and listening to music.</p>
      <p>With the development of the World Wide Web in 1989, it caused the whole music industry to adjust to the technological changes brought by it, which opened new ways for people to listen and acquire music. Music could be downloaded for free through sites like Napster and LimeWire though it also gave rise to copyright infringement and digital piracy. In contrast, platforms like YouTube and Pandora allowed users to listen to music legally and for free. Then came download-to-own services, letting users to legally download and own music. Beginning in the 21st Century and onwards, technological advancements have made smartphones come with multiple functions as well as access to the internet, which has finally brought us to music streaming in the present time.</p>
      <p>As the current major face of the music industry, streaming changed the recording, distribution, and consumption of music. Before, artists had to sign with record labels in order for their music to reach a wide audience and for their name to be known amongst those in the industry, thereby guaranteeing their success. But because of streaming, it gave rise to independent artists who do everything by themselves, from creation, to promotion, and to distribution.</p>
      <p>Today, the music industry is guided by technology, making the recording, distribution, and consumption of music easier, convenient, and less complex, with fewer resources needed and with almost low to zero cost.</p>
